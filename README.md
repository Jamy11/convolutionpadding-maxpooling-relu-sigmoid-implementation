# convolutionpadding-maxpooling-relu-sigmoid-implementation

#My task to take a image and take at least 5 kernal. I took 8.
#the the task was conv relu conv relu maxpool conv relu maxpool conv relu maxpool 

#after relu i stackd all the relu images in a singel images or i summed all the relu images

I stared work with assignment 2
After many changes i faced a problem in 2D and 3D images
I faced the problem when i did the max pooling
Thats when i copy the assignment 2 and made assignment 2_2D
assignment 2 is for 3d image and its not fully completed as i can not implement max pooling
 on the other hand assignment 2_2D is for 2D images and its fully completed as i could do the max pooling
